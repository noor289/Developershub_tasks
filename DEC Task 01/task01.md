Task 01: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

---

## Objective
The objective of this task is to explore and visualize a simple dataset to understand its structure, feature relationships, and data distribution using Python.

---

## Dataset
**Iris Dataset**

The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers with the following attributes:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

---

## Approach
The following steps were performed:
- Loaded the Iris dataset using pandas  
- Inspected dataset structure using `.shape`, `.columns`, and `.head()`  
- Checked for missing values and basic statistics  
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Created visualizations:
  - Scatter plot for feature relationships  
  - Histogram for data distribution  
  - Box plot for spread and outlier detection  

---

## Results & Insights
- The dataset contains 150 records with no missing values.
- Petal features show clear separation among species.
- Iris Setosa is easily distinguishable from other species.
- The dataset is well-structured and suitable for further analysis.
